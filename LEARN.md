# Js_algorithms_and_data_structures

Welcome to the Js_algorithms_and_data_structures repository! This repository contains various algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download and install the latest version of Node.js from the official website https://nodejs.org/.

To download and install this project, simply clone the repository using the following command:


```
git clone https://github.com/ArnaudBand/Js_algorithms_and_data_structures.git
Once the repository is downloaded, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the project dependencies:
```
```
npm install
Usage
This repository contains several algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript. To use any of these algorithms or data structures in your own project, simply copy the corresponding file(s) from this repository into your own project.
```
Each file contains an implementation of a specific algorithm or data structure, along with examples of how to use it. Refer to the comments in each file for documentation on the implementation details and usage instructions.

## Roadmap

We are constantly updating this repository with new algorithms and data structures. Some planned additions include:

- Implementation of a priority queue
- Implementation of the Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding shortest paths in a graph
- More sorting algorithms, such as quicksort and mergesort
