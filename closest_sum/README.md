## Closest num

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the triplet that has the closest sum to a target value. For example, if the input array is [-1, 2, 1, -4] and the target value is 1, the function should return [-1, 1, 2], because the sum of these three integers (-1 + 1 + 2 = 2) is the closest to the target value.
