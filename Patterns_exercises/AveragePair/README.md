### AveragePair

Write a function called averagePair that takes in a sorted array of integers and a target average, and returns true if there is a pair of values in the array where the average of the pair equals the target average. If no such pair exists, return false.

For example, averagePair([1,2,3], 2.5) should return true because (2+3)/2 equals 2.5.

Use the multiple pointers pattern to solve this problem.
