### Anagrams

Write a function called anagrams that takes in two strings as input and returns true if they are anagrams of each other, and false otherwise.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

For example, the words "listen" and "silent" are anagrams of each other because they use the same letters.

Use the frequency counter pattern to solve this problem.
