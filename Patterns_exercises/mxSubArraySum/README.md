Write a function called maxSubarraySum that takes in an array of integers and a positive integer n, and returns the maximum sum of n consecutive elements in the array.

For example, given the array [1, 2, 5, 2, 8, 1, 5] and n equal to 2, the function should return 10 because the largest sum of 2 consecutive elements in the array is 8 + 2.

You can use the sliding window pattern to solve this problem.
