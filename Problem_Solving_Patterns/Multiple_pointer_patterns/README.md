## Multiple Pointer

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards to begining, end or middle based on certain conditions.

Very efficient for solving problem with minimal space complexity as well.

### Example

Write function called sumZero which accepts a  sorted array of integers. the function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist.
