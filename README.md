# JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of data structures and algorithms in JavaScript. Created as part of a Data Structures and Algorithms course, it features organized folders for each topic, with README files providing overviews, use cases, and complexity analysis. Sample problems and solutions, along with test cases, are also included.

## Getting Started
To use the code in this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ArnaudBand/Js_algorithms_and_data_structures.git

```
You can then navigate to the appropriate folder for the data structure or algorithm you want to use, and open the corresponding JavaScript file.

## Data Structures
The following data structures are included in this repository:

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Search Tree
- Hash Table
- Graph
Each data structure folder includes a README.md file with an overview of the data structure, its use cases, and its time and space complexity.

## Algorithms
The following algorithms are included in this repository:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Binary Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- Each algorithm folder includes a README.md file with an overview of the algorithm, its use cases, and its time and space complexity. Sample problems and solutions, along with test cases, are also included.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this repository, please check the contribution guidelines and code of conduct. You can then fork the repository, create a new branch for your changes, and submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome in the form of bug fixes, new data structures and algorithms, and improved test cases.
